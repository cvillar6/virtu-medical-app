            A large health system struggled with fragmented patient data spread
            across multiple departments, leading to care delays and
            inefficiencies. By implementing Virtu's Analytics Portal, they
            centralized patient records, lab results, and referrals.

            This resulted in reduced wait times, improved coordination between
            departments, and a 20% increase in patient satisfaction scores.
            Additionally, the system’s Revenue Module identified areas for cost
            savings in medication and staffing.
